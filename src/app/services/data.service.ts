While at sea, all students actively participate in the sailing and running of the ship. All tracks include hands-on research, and SEA Semester is known for its academic excellence and low student-teacher ratio. Seven academic tracks are available, and students should check SEA Semester’s schedule to verify which semester each track will be offered.
